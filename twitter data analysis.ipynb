Fox Party set up &amp; anointed their man Jeb Bush Nothing about the really matters. If the world is going to be a better place, we need a total sea change in the human condition Congress &amp; morons like can pass a bill WITHOUT reading it, but Trump better not call someone a slob. Trying to get over last night\\'s debacle Rupert Murdoch &amp; Valerie Jarrett gushing over Jeb Bush (&amp; each other) Let\\'s just decide who our next is by having a Political Hunger Games In summary So many great jokes on Twitter tonight about the but not as many as there were on stage. This stinks so far. Recap of the these want to make choices for all women. Trump is a victim! I use the laws just like hundreds and hundreds of people! Marco Rubio\\'s campaign slogan needs to be \"from bar back to president\" ur complaining so much about being targeted but do u think that when ur president u won\\'t be targeted? The candidates don\\'t have to attack Fox is doing it for them by stoping him from speaking. 🇺🇸 The only debate anyone really cares about Kelly: \"I really want to get to a question from Facebook.\" Yes. That\\'s the problem. .@cenkuygur Cancel primaries. Fox Party set up &amp; anointed their man Jeb Bush Pres Obama has more brains in his little toe than all you totally fucking idiots have in your whole families combined … 10 men on stage discussing one woman. Who did Megyn Kelly ask about racism in America? Ben Carson - why, because he\\'s a neurosurgeon? Fox is cherry picking the candidates. Jeb gets the softball questions. 🇺🇸 Not a senior nor a junior at the last night was fit for the presidency. What MSM does not have the guts to say. I\\'d really like to see how long each candidate was given to speak. It didn\\'t seem \"Fair &amp; Balanced\" at all. 🇺🇸 The GOP debate took an awful toll on Ted Cruz. To get any job, you need a great resume ... except if the job is according to I think Cruz and Trump need to band together and expose this set up job, and get rid of Bush and Rubio, 🇺🇸 Jeb Stands By \"Act of Love\"; Comments and Earned Legal Status [BOO] Hey Trump he\\'s your man, if he can\\'t lose it, nobody can! Well actually all u showed in is LOSERS is not legit I\\'m sorry Ted Cruz looks like the son of Mr Haney from Green Acres! lol! Watching the like... F**K and those who would actually abandon their conservative values in support of his ridiculous candida… It\\'s 2015 &amp; we\\'re asking candidates what specifically a supernatural being told them to do. I don\\'t want a Pres who hears voices. The names you call women is not about being politically correct, it\\'s about showing respect If I understand his statement correctly, Mike Huckabee believes fertilized eggs should be able to vote. Have you no shame? U ever gone back looked at the words you learned at seminary u know not bear false witness misogynist, ignorant, xenophobic and greedy: another proof that money does not buy class. EARTH TO THIS AINT ABOUT YOU! Scott Walker is frightening. Like, when he speaks it\\'s as if he\\'s detached from reality and is just speaking. If Walker, Paul or Huckabee had to meet with Putin or command our armies they\\'d shit their pants. Not president material. … It is just me or can anyone else not wait for SNL this weekend for the debate coverage? I\\'ll tell you the one good thing about candidates are tripping over themselves to outdo each other in sexism… You can\\'t accuse the of being bigoted because they had a token woman &amp; both a token black &amp; Hispanic. Just because I\\'m not 35 and this is past my bed time doesn\\'t mean I shouldn\\'t be allowed to debate! I loved Huckabee\\'s work in \"The Grinch who Stole Christmas.\" You\\'d think GOP voters would demand more than this asinine \"I\\'m a man\\'s man. I grab my cock, screw my wife &amp; love Jesus\"… Why did NONE of the 9 men respond to Name Calling question: That\\'s abhorrent, but name calling pales next to ISIS sexual jihad. So posed for adult pictures.should we bring that up? To me it looked like Jeb doing Ferrell doing W. Failure: Hilary however can &amp; will win. It\\'s why, at she was the most talked about person. They know they can\\'t beat her! Every time the camera cuts to Trump, he\\'s grimacing like he\\'s trying to break wind but avoid the shart... Why aren\\'t they enforcing the don\\'t speak after the bell rule? You would never know is the frontrunner from watching this debate. 🇺🇸 Political debates teach marketers how not to message to audiences today. Be direct don\\'t deflect! I\\'d really like to see how long each candidate was given to speak. It didn\\'t seem \"Fair &amp; Balanced\" at all. 🇺🇸 Wow look at all the diversity in the GOP! It is very disappointing that Fox News is not conducting a \"Fair &amp; Balanced\" Debate. 🇺🇸 proved that Women in the US are more likely to be assaulted by men (verbally &amp; physically) than any kind of \\'terrorist\\' attack. It was not a debate, it was just a heavily biased Q&amp;A. Done! That\\'s it folks! I\\'m confused LOL Please stop talking about Ronald Reagan they way Ronald Reagan talked about Abraham Lincoln. Srsly America, if you give one of those guys the launch code to the nukes I live right under their flightpath, so *please* don\\'t Congrats the were harder to watch than the rape scene in IRREVERSIBLE. I was really looking for a debate of the candidates not an attack on Trump - Dear Marco Rubio, just shut the fuck up, you are neither entertaining or wise. Who had the MOST face time in the Why , of course. Is she running for something?She needs to.S… Can we ask Scott Walker why he\\'s disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of people with voter ID laws? If I wanted to watch this many white men that hate women talk I\\'d have gone to an open mic. When will they learn? attack and he wins &amp; poll. Serious question about the Did any candidate...ANY of them... put forth a vision that will resonate with a VOTING MAJORITY? No. Why doesn\\'t Chris Wallace ask the other politicans about their finances and where their money comes from? 🇺🇸 … Jebby talking changing tax code to fix \"job killers\". Is that Jebspeak for give corporations more tax breaks? The candidates don\\'t have to attack Fox is doing it for them by stoping him from speaking. 🇺🇸 \"Consequences of Obama/Clinton admin...\" Like increased diplomacy, rational decision-making and working to eliminate xenophobia? FOR SHIT\\'S SAKE... TURN ON THE TV AND IT WAS STILL ON FOX FROM THE AND ALL I SEE IS PEOPLE GOBBLING \\'S KNOB. How disgusting is tone, Show some respect toward\\'s God and all of us who put him first in our lives! Sending troops to our mommy-parts! Huckabee. No way around it, the GOP has to be embarrassed and discouraged after last nights spectacle...#GOPDebate Watched the last night, which is very unlike me. Feels like a complete joke with Trump on stage. Seriously?! has shown Republicans have no answers for future--more interested in turning back the clock on progress 3AM tweet brags of winning debate with a \"dumb panel\" by \"massive amount\". Less-dumb panel\" would trounce him massively So Donald Trump is Biff from Back to the Future 2?

Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace SUCK! Reading a lot of polls/tweets about who won lastnight\\'s GOP debate. Not one of those winners was logic. At certain (not rare) moments the seemed for pres elec in middle ages. Seriously, u r welcome to the 21th century, plz come in, Fox is cherry picking the candidates. Jeb gets the softball questions. 🇺🇸 Any candidate that rejects Common Core without a legitimate and thoughtful alternative should NOT be taken seriously. The candidates don\\'t have to attack Fox is doing it for them by stoping him from speaking. 🇺🇸 Today\\'s GOP is a crazy white dude in a darkened theater. They are out to destroy us. Dr. Carson talking about race is like trump talking about money. It was unfathomable that would ask Wasserman-Schultz to do a postmortem on the \"Way to not answer the question\" -my dad at the TV all night No clear winners in the last night. The circus continues! bright spot in all this is that while Hilary might not be enough to galvanize the democratic base, defeating Trump certainly is. I think Cruz and Trump need to band together and expose this set up job, and get rid of Bush and Rubio, 🇺🇸 Who else is watching the new episode of The Biggest Loser on right now? If you missed either all you need to know is there\\'s no $ for struggling Americans and unlimited $ for war.
